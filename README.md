# ðŸ”Œ Smart Home Automation System â€“ ESP32 IoT Project

##  Aim
To simulate a smart home automation system that:
- Continuously detects human movement using a PIR sensor
- Monitors ambient light using an LDR sensor
- Automatically controls lights and sends real-time alerts to the cloud when motion is detected in low-light conditions

---

##  Problem Statement

Simulate a smart home automation system that:
- (a) Continuously detects human movement using a PIR sensor and monitors ambient light using an LDR sensor.
- (b) Automatically controls lights and sends real-time alerts to the cloud when motion is detected in low-light conditions, indicating the presence of a person in a dark environment.

---

##  Scope of the Solution

This project demonstrates how a home automation system can:
- Automate lighting based on occupancy and ambient light
- Log environmental and security-related data (motion, temperature, humidity, light) to the cloud in real time
- Enable remote monitoring and future scalability (e.g., alerts, dashboards, automation rules)

##  Required Components

###  Hardware:
- ESP32 microcontroller
- PIR Motion Sensor
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- DHT22 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor)
- LED (representing a smart light)
- Resistors
- Breadboard and jumper wires

###  Software:
- Arduino IDE (for code development)
- Wokwi Simulator (for testing without hardware)

###  Cloud Environment:
- [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/) account
  - For real-time cloud monitoring of sensor values
